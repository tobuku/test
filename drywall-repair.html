      <h2>Common drywall problems we repair</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Many of our calls start with the same stories. A small leak turned into damage, movers put a hole in the wall,
        or an old repair was never finished correctly. Here are the issues we handle every week on Oahu.
      </p>

      <div class="services-grid">
        <div class="service-card">
          <h3>Water damaged drywall</h3>
          <p>
            Cut out and replacement of wet or mold prone drywall after plumbing leaks, roof leaks and AC issues,
            followed by clean finishes that match the surrounding area.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-card">
          <h3>Holes, dents and impact damage</h3>

        </div>
        <div class="service-card">
          <h3>Cracks and seam problems</h3>

          <h3>Remodel and electrician patching</h3>
          <p>
            Repairs after new lighting, plumbing or remodeling work so your home does not look patched or unfinished.

      <h2>How our drywall repair process works</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        We keep repair projects simple, clear and organized so you know what is happening in your home at each step.
      </p>

      <div class="why-grid">
        <div class="why-card">
          <h3>1. Walkthrough and estimate</h3>
          <p>
            We review the damage in person, talk through the cause of the problem and explain whether a patch,
            partial replacement or full replacement is the best option. You receive a written estimate with clear scope and pricing.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why-card">
          <h3>2. Repair and prep work</h3>
          <p>
            Floors and furniture are protected, damaged drywall is removed as needed and new material is installed,
            taped and finished. We sand and prep the area so it is ready for your painter.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why-card">
          <h3>3. Texture and clean up</h3>
          <p>
            If your walls or ceilings have a texture, we match it as closely as possible so the repair blends in.
            Work areas are cleaned and debris is removed before we leave.

      <h2>Drywall repair pricing on Oahu</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Every home and building is different, but most drywall repair projects fall into a few common ranges.
        These are general guidelines to help you plan. Your actual estimate will be based on site conditions and scope.

      <div class="services-grid">
        <div class="service-card">
          <h3>Small repairs</h3>
          <p>
            Small holes, dents and minor cracks in one or two rooms. Often completed in a single visit
            with one follow up visit for final sanding or texture.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-card">
          <h3>Medium repairs</h3>
          <p>
            Larger holes, multiple rooms, or moderate water damage in ceilings and walls. Includes cut out,
            replacement, taping, mudding and texture work.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-card">
          <h3>Larger restoration</h3>
          <p>
            Extensive water damage, long cracks, or multiple rooms and ceilings requiring framing corrections
            and new drywall. Scheduled more like a small remodel with staged visits.
          </p>

      </div>

      <p style="margin-top:1.5rem; font-size:0.95rem; color:#4b5563;">
        For insurance related water damage, we can coordinate with your adjuster or restoration company so repairs
        are completed at the right stage of the project.

      <h2>Drywall repair FAQ</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        A few common questions homeowners across Honolulu ask before scheduling drywall repair.
      </p>

      <div class="testimonial-grid">
        <div class="testimonial-card">
          <h3 style="margin-bottom:0.4rem;">Do you repair small holes or only big jobs?</h3>
          <p>
            We handle everything from small patches to larger repairs. If the repair is too small to make sense as a
            stand alone visit, we can often combine it with other work in your home to keep it cost effective.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="testimonial-card">
          <h3 style="margin-bottom:0.4rem;">Can you match my existing wall or ceiling texture?</h3>
          <p>
            In most cases we can get very close to your existing texture. Before we finish, we review the area with you
            so you can see how it blends once it is dry and ready for paint.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="testimonial-card">
          <h3 style="margin-bottom:0.4rem;">Do I need to paint after the repair?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. We leave the repaired area sanded and ready for paint or primer. Some clients prefer to paint on their own,
            others have us coordinate with their painter or refer a painter.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="testimonial-card">
          <h3 style="margin-bottom:0.4rem;">How soon can you start a repair?</h3>
          <p>
            Schedule depends on workload and the size of your project, but smaller repairs can often be fit into the
            schedule faster than full remodels. When you contact us, we will give you an honest time frame.
